</div><div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Convenience Is Not an -ility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
APIs are supposed to hide underlying complexity.
</p>

<p>
A good API follows a consistent level of abstraction, exhibits consistency and symmetry, and forms the vocabulary for an expressive language, which enables the next layer above to ask and answer useful questions.
</p>

<p>
A diverse vocabulary allows us to express subtleties in meaning. For example, we prefer to say <code>run()</code> instead of <code>walk(true)</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> The Golden Rule of API Design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
When designing and API, you have to think about how you might change it in the future and whether the changes might break client code. The easiest way is to lock down the API, present the API through a singleton or use <code>static</code> factory methods to guard it from people who might override behavior.
</p>

<p>
It's not enough to write tests for an API you develop; you have to write unit tests for code that uses your API. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Architecture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
</div><div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Better Scalability in Parallel Systems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Concurrency, and especially parallelism, a special subset of concurrency is hard. Almost all the <span class="underline">problems of concurrency relate to the use of shared mutable memory</span>: race conditions, deadlock, livelock, etc.
</p>

<p>
Harnessing true parallelism becomes more important, because computers have more cores, and we can no longer rely on increasing processor clock speeds to improve application performance.
</p>

<p>
Instead of using threads and shared memory as programming model, we can use processes and message passing. Such systems do not have all the synchronization stresses that shared-memory, multithreaded systems have. Use — or, if they don't exist, create — libraries and frameworks that provide process models and message passing, avoiding all use of shared mutable memory.
</p>

<p>
A formal model, Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), can be applied as part of the engineering of such systems.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively we can adopt dataflow systems as a way of computing. In a dataflow system, there is no explicitly programmed control flow. Instead, a directed graph of operators, connected by data paths, is set up and then data is fed into the system. Evaluation is controlled by the readiness of data within the system. There is no synchronization problem.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Large, Interconnected Data Belongs to a Database</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
<del>Embedded database systems</del> can be linked as libraries directly into the application, requiring almost no setup or management. Two notable open source ones are SQLite and HSQLDB.
</p>

<p>
If the application's data is larger than the system's RAM, an indexed RDBMS table will perform orders of magnitude faster than the library's map collection type, which will thrash virtual memory pages.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage of basing code around an RDBMS involves the handling of relationships between data elements. You can describe consistency constraints on data in a declarative way, avoiding the risk of the dangling pointers if you forget to update data in an edge case.
</p>

<p>
You can also create efficient links between the entities stored in the database at any time, simply by creating an index.
</p>

<p>
Coding around a database allows multiple applications to access data in a safe way. This makes it easy to upgrade the application for concurrent use and also to code each part of the application using the most appropriate language and platform.
</p>

<p>
RDBMS will optimize SQL commands, allowing you to concentrate on the application's functionality rather than on algorithmic tuning.
</p>

</div><div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Floating-Point Numbers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Floating-point numbers have limited precision. They are approximations of real numbers. Floating-point numbers are intended for efficient scientific computation.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name">Floating-point numbers are not evenly spaced throughout their range:</label>
<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">float</span> <span class="org-variable-name">a</span> = 2147483647;   <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">Largest 32-bit signed integer</span>
printf(<span class="org-string">"%f\n"</span>, a);      <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">2147483648.000000</span>
printf(<span class="org-string">"%f\n"</span>, a - 64); <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">2147483648.000000</span>
printf(<span class="org-string">"%f\n"</span>, a - 65); <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">2147483520.000000</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Because the spacing between adjacent floats in that range is 128, and floating-point operations round to the nearest floating-point number.
</p>

<p>
Don't use floating-point numbers for financial applications — that's what <code>decimal</code> classes in languages like Python and C# are for.

<h3 id="sec-4-1"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Keep the Build Clean</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Ignoring things is mental work. Get rid of all the unnecessary mental work. When something appears that it is unnecessary to see, deal with it right away, (instead of deciding if it is irrelevant every time it is encountered).
</p>

<p>
Keeping the build clean is not just about keeping it free of compilation errors or test failures: warnings are also an important and critical part of code hygiene.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> The Linker</h3>

<p>
A linker does:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>concatenate together the code and data sections of the object files
</li>
<li>connect the references to symbols with their definitions
</li>
<li>pull unresolved symbols out of the library

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-5">
<p>
<span class="underline">Tests can demonstrate the presence of features, but tests cannot prove the absence of bugs.</span> To write code that is correct, and have evidence on hand that it is correct, we need to think about the "size" of a function — the size of the mathematical function that the code manifests.
</p>

<p>
A mathematical function can be understood as a set, some subset of the Cartesian product of the sets that are its domain (all possible arguments) and range (all possible results).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name">In the game of Go there is a condition called atari in which a player's stones may be captured by opponent: a stone with 2 or more free spaces adjacent to it (called liberties) is not in atari.</label>

    libertyCount &lt; 2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If argument <code>int</code> can have 2^32 = 4,294,976,296 different values, and result <code>boolean</code> can have 2 values, then there are 8,589,934,592 members in the Cartesian product of the sets, and half of these belong to the subset which is the function. To provide complete evidence that the function is correct, it will need to check around 4.3E9 examples.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name">The nature of Go means that the number of liberties of a stone is not any <code>int</code>, but exactly one of <code>{1,2,3,4}</code>. So it can be alternatively wrote:</label>
<pre class="src src-c">LibertyCount = {1,2,3,4}
<span class="org-type">boolean</span> <span class="org-function-name">atari</span>(<span class="org-type">LibertyCount</span> <span class="org-variable-name">libertyCount</span>)
    libertyCount == 1

<h3 id="sec-8-3"><span class="section-number-3">8.3</span> Two Wrongs Can Make a Right</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-3">
<p>
Code never lies, but it can contradict itself.
</p>

<p>
Consider a function that returns a completion status. Imagine that it returns <code>false</code> when it should return <code>true</code>. Now imagine that the calling function neglects to check the return value. Everything works fine until one day someone notices the missing check and inserts it.
</p>

<p>
Consider an application that stores state as an XML document. Imagine that one of the nodes is incorrectly written as <code>TimeToLive</code> instead of <code>TimeToDie</code>, as the documentation says it should. Everything appears fine while the writer code and the reader code both contain the same error. But fix one, or add a new application reading the same document, and the symmetry is broken.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">When two defects in the code create one visible fault, the methodical approach to fixing faults can itself break down.</span> When the first defect is fixed, the second defect is at work. So the first fix is removed. The second underlying defect is found, and a fix applied for that. But the first defect has returned. The process repeats.
</p>

<p>
The problem also exists in written requirements documents. An error in the code compensates for an error in the written description.
</p>

<p>
Single wrongs can be easy to spot and easy to fix. It is the problems with multiple causes, needing multiple changes, that are harder to resolve. In part, this is because <span class="underline">easy problems are so easily fixed that people tend to fix them relatively quickly and store up the more difficult problems for a later date</span>.

<h3 id="sec-11-1"><span class="section-number-3">11.1</span> The Singleton Pattern</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-1">
<p>
The single-instance requirement is often imagined. In many cases, it's pure speculation that no additional instances will be needed in the future. <span class="underline">Requirements will change. Good design embraces this.</span> Singletons don't.
</p>

<p>
Singletons cause implicit dependencies between conceptually independent units of code.
</p>

<p>
Singletons also carry implicit persistent state, which hinders unit testing. Unit testing depends on tests being independent of one another, so the tests can be run in any order and the program can be set to a known state before the execution of every unit test. Once singletons with mutable state are introduced, this may be hard to achieve. Such globally accessible persistent state makes it harder to reason about the code, especially in a multithreaded environment.
</p>

<p>
The cleanup of singletons may present a final challenge. There is no support for explicitly killing singletons. There is no order to the implicit cleanup of singletons at program exit. This can be troublesome for applications that contain singletons with interdependencies.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Restrict use of the Singleton pattern to the classes that truly must never be instantiated more than once.
</li>
<li>Don't use a singleton's global access point from arbitrary code. Instead, direct access to the singleton should come from only a few well-defined places, from where it can be passed around via an interface. User code of the interface does not depend on whether a singleton or any other kind of class implements the interface.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
"Computer science" was about spending effort mapping the real world into the restrictive data structures.
</p>

<p>
Making domain concepts explicit in the code means other programmers can gather the intent of the code much more easily than by trying to retrofit an algorithm into what they understand about a domain.
</p>

<p>
Coupled with good encapsulation, the chances are good that the rule will exist in only one place. When the domain model evolves, you are in a good position to evolve the code.

<h3 id="sec-12-2"><span class="section-number-3">12.2</span> Prefer Domain-Specific Types</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-2">
<p>
On September 23, 1999, the $327.6 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost while entering orbit around Mars due to a software error back on Earth. The error was later called the metric mix-up. The ground-station software was working in pounds, while the spacecraft expected newtons, leading the ground station to underestimate the power of the spacecraft’s thrusters by a factor of 4.45.
</p>

<p>
One of Ada language's primary design goals was to implement embedded safety-critical software. Ada has strong typing with static checking for both primitive types and user-defined types.
</p>

<p>
In other languages, domain-specific typing can be applied by using classes instead primitive types:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The code becomes more readable, as it expresses concepts of a domain.
</li>
<li>The code becomes more testable, as the code encapsulates behavior.
</li>
<li>The code facilitates reuse.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Developers using statically typed languages get some help from the compiler, while those embracing dynamically typed languages are more likely to rely on their unit tests.

<h3 id="sec-13-1"><span class="section-number-3">13.1</span> Business Exceptions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-13-1">
<p>
There are basically two reasons that things go wrong at runtime:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Technical problems that prevent us from using the application.
</li>
<li>Business logic that prevents us from misusing the application.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is a potential source of confusion to represent them both using the same exception hierarchy. Separating the cases gives clarity and increases the chances that technical exceptions will be handled by some application framework, while the business domain exceptions actually are considered and handled by the client code.
</p>

<p>
An unresolvable technical problem can occur when there is a programming error. Let the exception bubble up to the highest architectural level and let some general exception-handling mechanism do what it can to ensure that the system is in a safe state, such as rolling back a transaction, logging and alerting administration, and reporting back (politely) to the user.
</p>

<p>
An exception: the situation where you cannot complete the call for a domain-logical reason. Unusual and undesirable, but not bizarre or programmatically in error. Throwing an exception is just an alternative return path that is part of the model and that the client should be aware of and be prepared to handle. It is appropriate to create a specific exception or a separate exception hierarchy so that the client can handle the situation on its own terms.

Simulate load on the system during system testing, looking at a noise-free error log is also a good first indication that the system is reasonably robust.

<p>
Programming expertise is related directly to the number of different programming paradigms that a programmer is comfortable with, that he can genuinely program with.
</p>

<p>
It generally takes a good few months of use, even if part-time, to gain a proper working knowledge of a language. It is the idioms of use, not just the syntax and computational model, that are the important factors.

More often than not, existing code is working code. It has already gone through some sort of quality control and rigorous testing, and is being used successfully.
</p>

<p>
The same way that watching a movie about sailing is very different from going sailing, so too is using existing code versus designing your own software from the ground up, testing it, breaking it, repairing it, and improving it along the way.
</p>

<p>
There are lessons learned from trial and error that have an emotional component to them that reading a technical book alone just cannot deliver. Becoming a great programmer is as much about acquiring experience as it is about collecting facts.

Less experienced object-oriented developers might decide to wrap all the business rules into an object very often referred to as <code>OrderManager</code> or <code>OrderService</code>. In these designs, <code>Order</code>, <code>Customer</code>, and <code>Item</code> are treated as little more than record types. All logic is factored out of the classes and tied together in one large, procedural method with a lot of internal <code>if-then-else</code> constructs. These methods are easily broken and are almost impossible to maintain. The reason? The encapsulation is broken.

Much performance management literature still focuses on data structures and algorithms, issues that can make a difference in some cases but are far less likely to dominate performance in modern multitier enterprise applications.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Optimize the interface between processes so that exactly the right data is exchanged with the minimum amount of interaction.

Caching and lookahead are used heavily at every level of the systems to hide this variation, but they only work when access is predictable. When cache misses are frequent, the system will be thrashing. Reaccessing recently used items and accessing items sequentially are usually a win.

Random access is not predictable. To randomly inspect every byte on a hard drive could take 32 years. Even to randomly inspect every byte in RAM could take 11 minutes.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-20-2">
<p>
Over the past few thousand years, engineers have developed mathematics and physics they can use for a structural solution without having to build it to see what it does. We don't have anything like that in software, and perhaps never will because software is in fact very different. the
building process in software is ridiculously cheap. We’ve developed an entire ecosystem of tools that make it easy to do just that: unit testing, mock objects, test harnesses.

There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-20-4">
<p>
More often than not, the test servers are idling overnight and over the weekend. You can use this to your advantage. Break down large test suite into two or more profiles:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A smaller, mandatory test profile that is quick to run will help to ensure that tests are run before each commit.
</li>
<li>Other test profiles can be automated to run overnight, ready to report their results in the morning.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Longer-running tests, or soak tests, are vital for identifying memory leaks and other stability issues.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-20-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Less time spent sending bugs back and forth through the defect tracking system.
</li>
<li>Less time wasted trying to figure out whether something is a bug or a new feature.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD): Testers write and automate acceptance tests using the language of their domain with tools such as Fit (Framework for Integrated Test), and give to the programmers before the coding begins. Programmers write the fixtures to run the tests, and then code to make the tests pass. Defects are prevented because the tests clarify many of the initial ideas. These tests then become part of the regression suite.
</p>

<p>
When testers stop thinking that their only job is to break the software and find bugs in the programmers' code, programmers stop thinking that testers are "out to get them", and are more open to collaboration.

Typically, when a tool is easy to use, it's because the tool is making decisions for you and doing a lot of things automatically, behind the scenes.

Command-line tools inherently support scripting, which allows for the automation of tasks such as producing scheduled daily builds, creating multiple versions of a project, and running test suites.

Unix tools were developed in an age when a multiuser computer had 128KB
of RAM. The ingenuity that went into their design means that nowadays they can handle huge data sets extremely efficiently.

Most tools work like filters, processing just a single line at the time, meaning that there is no upper limit in the amount of data they can handle.

Unix commands executing as pipelines, which naturally distribute their load among the many processing units of modern multicore CPUs.

Our ability to understand one another does not arise from shared definitions, it arises from a shared experience. Language is largely metaphorical, and that these metaphors offer an insight into how we understand the world.
</p>

<p>
For users, tools only become objects of interest when they don't work.
</p>

<p>
When programmers ask users about their desires for a system, they tend to ask for definitions built out of predicates. This is very convenient for programmers. The terms in the predicates can very easily become attributes on a class or columns in a table. But that just isn't how people in general understand the world. They understand it in ways that are based on examples.
